<?php 
$image = new Imagick('testimage.jpg'); 

$x = 1; 
$y = 1; 
$pixel = $image->getImagePixelColor($x, $y); 
?> 

If you try to print an output of the $pixel object, you get nothing. You have to use one of the ImagickPixel operations to get back a value. 

You can do either of the following: 

<?php 
$colors = $pixel->getColor(); 
print_r($colors); // produces Array([r]=>255,[g]=>255,[b]=>255,[a]=>1); 

$pixel->getColorAsString(); // produces rgb(255,255,255); 
?> 

The place where I was getting hung up was how to get the data that was captured in the Imagick::getImagePixelColor operation into an ImagickPixel object. I was trying to find ways of passing the value to a newly instantiated ImagickPixel object. Well, it appears that once you've captured your color data using Imagick::getImagePixelColor, what's returned IS an ImagickPixel object! 

As a further note, you do not need to convert this to a human readable format if you just want to take a color sample at a single point on your image to plug into another operation. 

For example, if you wanted to perform a flood fill effect on a certain color you could plug in the instance of the ImagickPixel object directly. 

The following fill perform a flood fill effect at coordinates 1,1 on your image using Green as the fill color and the color sampled at 1,1 as the target color to fill. 

<?php 
$hexcolor = '#00ff00'; 
$fuzz = '4000'; 
$x = 1; 
$y = 1; 
$pixel = $image->getImagePixelColor($x, $y); 
$image->floodfillPaintImage($hexcolor, $fuzz, $pixel, $x, $y, false); 
?>
